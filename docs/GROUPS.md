An example of a group definition looks like:
```
{
    // Name of group displayed in Component Chooser.
    "label": "MyComponents",

    // Unique identifier of this group.
    "name": 'group-identifier',

    // List of Components, by id, to display in order they are defined.
    "components": [
        "my-component-1",
        "my-component-2"
    ]
}
```
